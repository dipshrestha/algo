Daily Coding Problem: Problem #51 [Medium]

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
This problem was asked by Facebook.
Given a function that generates perfectly random numbers between 1 and k (inclusive), 
where k is an input, write a function that shuffles a deck of cards represented as an array using only swaps.
It should run in O(N) time.
Hint: Make sure each one of the 52! permutations of the deck is equally likely.

class ShuffleDeck {

  // Time: O(2^N)
  // Space: O(N)

}

module.exports = ShuffleDeck;
