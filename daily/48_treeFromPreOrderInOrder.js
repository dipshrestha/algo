Daily Coding Problem: Problem #48 [Medium]

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
This problem was asked by Google.
Given pre-order and in-order traversals of a binary tree, write a function to reconstruct the tree.
For example, given the following preorder traversal:
[a, b, d, e, c, f, g]
And the following inorder traversal:
[d, b, e, a, f, c, g]

You should return the following tree:

    a
   / \
  b   c
 / \ / \
d  e f  g

 */

/*
 Algo: 
*/
class TreeFromPreOrderInOrder{

  // Time: O(2^N)
  // Space: O(N)

}

module.exports = TreeFromPreOrderInOrder;
