Daily Coding Problem: Problem #55 [Easy]

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
This problem was asked by Microsoft.
Implement a URL shortener with the following methods:
shorten(url), which shortens the url into a six-character alphanumeric string, such as zLg6wl.
restore(short), which expands the shortened string into the original url. If no such shortened string exists, return null.
Hint: What if we enter the same URL twice?

class ShortenURL {

  // Time: O(2^N)
  // Space: O(N)

}

module.exports = ShortenURL;
