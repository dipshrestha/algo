Daily Coding Problem: Problem #69 [Easy]

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
This problem was asked by Facebook.
Given a list of integers, return the largest product that can be made by multiplying any three integers.
For example, if the list is [-10, -10, 5, 2], we should return 500, since that's -10 * -10 * 5.
You can assume the list has at least three integers.

class LargestThreeProduct {

  // Time: O(2^N)
  // Space: O(N)

}

module.exports = LargestThreeProduct;
