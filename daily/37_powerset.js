Daily Coding Problem: Problem #37 [Easy]

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
This problem was asked by Google.
The power set of a set is the set of all its subsets. Write a function that, given a set, generates its power set.
For example, given the set {1, 2, 3}, it should return {{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}.
You may also use a list or array to represent a set.

class Powerset {

}

module.exports = Powerset;
