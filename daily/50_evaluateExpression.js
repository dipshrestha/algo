Daily Coding Problem: Problem #50 [Easy]

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
This problem was asked by Microsoft.
Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a binary tree. Each leaf is an integer and each internal node is one of '+', '−', '∗', or '/'.
Given the root to such a tree, write a function to evaluate it.
For example, given the following tree:

    *
   / \
  +    +
 / \  / \
3  2  4  5
You should return 45, as it is (3 + 2) * (4 + 5).

class EvaluateExpression {

  // Time: O(2^N)
  // Space: O(N)

}

module.exports = EvaluateExpression;
