Daily Coding Problem: Problem #67 [Hard]

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
This problem was asked by Google.
Implement an LFU (Least Frequently Used) cache. It should be able to be initialized with a cache size n, and contain the following methods:
set(key, value): sets key to value. If there are already n items in the cache and we are adding a new item, then it should also remove the least frequently used item. If there is a tie, then the least recently used key should be removed.
get(key): gets the value at key. If no such key exists, return null.
Each operation should run in O(1) time.

 */

 Algo: Solve using backtracking

class LFU {

  // Time: O(2^N)
  // Space: O(N)

}

module.exports = LFU;
