Daily Coding Problem: Problem #52 [Hard]

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
This problem was asked by Google.
Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache. It should be able to be initialized with a cache size n, and contain the following methods:
set(key, value): sets key to value. If there are already n items in the cache and we are adding a new item, then it should also remove the
least recently used item.
get(key): gets the value at key. If no such key exists, return null.
Each operation should run in O(1) time.

class LRU {

  // Time: O(2^N)
  // Space: O(N)

}

module.exports = LRU;
